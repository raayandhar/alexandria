# alexandria
A collection of relatively unorganized notes, thoughts, annotations,
and more. Inspired by the [Great Library of
Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria)

This is a public-facing collection. It saps from a private collection
**rivendell** and is updated occasionally, typically when a note or
project is worth sharing. **alexandria** also contains `posts/`
which will be moved to my personal website as they are written.
At some point, this entire structure will be moved to my personal
website.

For a structure of the repository, refer to `structure.md`.
